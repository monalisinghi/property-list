# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## `yarn start`
I am using parcel to run the code in browser.
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.


## `yarn test`
I used Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test the code.


## `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

# Solution approach
I have used modular approach and brake down the code in separate files to make it easy to read and edit.
This approach helps with testing too.
